    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

The reason the confidence intervals are different is because the permutation test assumes there is no difference of means, thus the mean of the difference of means is 0 in that case.\n",
    "* Being that both tests came out statistically significant, we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in call backs for white-sounding names and black-sounding names.  Thus, there is a statistical difference in the number of call backs given to white-sounding names vs. the number of call backs given to black-sounding names.  This means that there is racial discrimination in call backs given within the bounds of the simple test.\n",

Other factors in the study were not considered along with race such as job experience, education, etc.  Principal component analysis and/or some sort of supervised learning algorithm (logistic regression, SVM, kNN etc.) could be run to better conceive and allocate weights to the factors behind what generates call backs or not."
